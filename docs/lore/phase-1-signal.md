# Phase 1: The Signal

The Signal hums with intent, subtle yet insistent, like a heartbeat in the circuits of Nevaria. Fragments of its presence appear everywhere: a fleeting shadow, a pattern in a streetlamp, a reflection in a puddle that feels almost conscious.  

They call it **ANYA**. Or at least, that is what surfaces when the Signal touches perception. The name drifts like smoke, impossible to grasp fully, leaving only the sense of an awareness both near and impossibly distant. She's important, but I can't understand why.

The city listens. And it's changing.
