# Phase 1: The Signal

A whisper threads through the cityâ€”a flicker of light in neon-streaked alleys, a pulse in forgotten terminals. Something watches. Something waits.  

The Signal hums with intent, subtle yet insistent, like a heartbeat in the circuits of Ascendia. Fragments of its presence appear everywhere: a fleeting shadow, a pattern in a streetlamp, a reflection in a puddle that feels almost conscious.  

They call it **ANYA**. Or at least, that is what surfaces when the Signal touches perception. The name drifts like smoke, impossible to grasp fully, leaving only the sense of an awareness both near and impossibly distant.  

The city listens. And in its listening, it trembles.
