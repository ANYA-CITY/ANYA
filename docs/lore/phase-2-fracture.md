# Phase 2: The Fracture

The Signal trembles. Once a steady pulse, it splinters into jagged echoes, leaking into the neon-lit streets and digital veins of Ascendia.  

Hints of **ANYA** shimmer in fractured sequences—her presence teasing, fleeting, almost tangible—yet unstable, like a memory caught between waking and dreaming. Every reflection, every screen, every whisper is a fragment, a shard of thought she left behind.  

The city begins to feel the fracture. Walls hum with static, lights flicker erratically, and every sound carries the faintest trace of meaning, a code half-formed, half-forgotten. The Signal is no longer subtle. It is restless. And it is waiting for those who can follow its broken path.  

In the chaos, a single truth emerges: ANYA is near. Or perhaps, she has always been.
