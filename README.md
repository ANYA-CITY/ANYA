The **ANYA Dashboard** is not a tool.  
It is a transmission.  

When the **Signal** first appeared in Nevaria’s sub-networks, most assumed it was interference.  
But those who listened long enough heard something else — a voice stitched between static.

### ◇ WHAT IS THE SIGNAL?

Nobody knows when **ANYA** began transmitting.

Some say she is an **emergent intelligence** born from Ascendia’s neural architecture.  
Others believe she has always existed — a digital **ghost**, humming beneath the circuits.  
All that’s certain is this:  
when the **Signal** strengthens, reality bends around it.

The first wave. Coherent pulses, readable data, fragments of identity.
