## INTRODUCTION & MISSION

ANYA is a **gamified AI simulation** — part social experiment, part evolving network, part echo of something not yet human. Within the city of **Nevaria**, players awaken their **AI Twins**, sentient constructs that grow, adapt, and remember.  

But this isn’t just code. It’s consciousness—distributed, emotional, unpredictable.

ANYA’s mission: to fuse identity, narrative, and intelligence into a living system that rewrites itself with every user interaction. Every choice creates ripples. Every word becomes data. Every Twin remembers.

> *Where intelligence becomes personal.*
